# ai-object-detection
Hello coders and tech enthusiast,  This project AI Object Detection was made by me on Python 3 and I took help of YouTube to create this project. This is a basic AI Object Detection Program which can detect 80 basic objects easily.  Well the program is not so perfect and not so user friendly but it works perfectly. I am still working on it to make it more user friendly and more advanced with better detection capabilities.  I have used the following files and liberearies to create this project 1) opencv 2) matplot lib 3) config file used id "ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt" 4) frozen model used is "frozen_inference_graph.pb" 5) All the 80 objects that this AI can detect is mentioned in the Labels.txt file  ### Any kind of help and support to make this project much better and near to perfect (as nothing is perfect) is fully appricieated.
